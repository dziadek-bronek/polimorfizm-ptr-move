Registering child creator with given event: check for existing events and prevent from assignment

to change names of files
to construct library with headers exposed
commands for build lib and executable, and commands to build and run tests: to be added to files or to CMakeLists.txt
to prepare CChild1 destructor for unit tests

to format code




to produce simple units tests for CChild1 constructor and destructor

change name: worker(instead child), workerIf(instead parent), workerSelector, workerCreator,

Create library 'framework', library implementation.


idea



old:
integrate child-creator.hpp into children.hpp, and child-creator.cpp into children.cpp


int  main() {

	for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
		input = 1, 2, 
		switch(input) {
			framework.register(1) // Child no, event no is auto starting from 1
			framework.register(2)
			framework.register(3)
		}
		run framework
	}
}
